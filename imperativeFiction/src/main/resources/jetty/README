This is the source code for org.tads.jetty.Jetty, my TADS 2 interpreter. For more
information, you should take a look at my webpage, which as of this
writing is at http://www.drizzle.com/~dans/if/jetty/. 

org.tads.jetty.Jetty is released with the understanding that people should feel free
to modify it, fix bugs, add features, whatever. If you find a bug or
make an improvement I would appreciate if you let me know so I can
update the main source, but it's not required. The specific license
under which this code is distributed is in the file 'license.txt' in
this distribution. 

If you're just interested in running this and not messing around with the 
source, you probably want the compiled jar version, available both on the 
if archive, probably http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/interpreters-tads/,
and on my webpage mentioned above.

Note that this does not include the source for the regexp package, which is
by the Jakarta project, not by me. If you want that source (and you'll
need it or the jarfile to compile org.tads.jetty.Jetty), you can get it at
http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html.
